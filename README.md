This is our Final Year Project code repository. We have developed an application to predict human emotion and its intensity using Machine Learning algorithms. We have trained our model using a neural network that will categorize emotions and assign intensity to each one of them. This model is connected to an Android application which aims to facilitate mental health professionals during diagnosis of their patients.
